Heroin,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB01452/thumb.svg,"Diamorphine (heroin) is a narcotic analgesic that may be habit-forming. It is a controlled substance (opium derivative) listed in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21 Parts 329.1, 1308.11 (1987). Sale is forbidden in the United States by Federal statute. (Merck Index, 11th ed) Internationally, diamorphine is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. As heroin, it is illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell in the United States and the UK. However, under the name diamorphine, heroin is a legal prescription drug in the United Kingdom.",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01452
Fentanyl,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB00813/thumb.svg,"Fentanyl, a potent opioid agonist, was developed in the 1950s to fill a need for strong and rapid analgesia. Because of these characteristics, fentanyl is commonly used to treat chronic cancer pain or in anesthesia. Fentanyl is related to other opioids like morphine and oxycodone. Fentanyl's high potency has also made it a common adulterant in illicit drugs, especially heroin. In 2017, 47,600 overdose deaths in the United States involved some opioid (over 2/3 of all overdose deaths). Opioid overdoses kill an average of 11 Canadians daily.",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00813
Cocaine,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB00907/thumb.svg,"An alkaloid ester extracted from the leaves of plants including coca. It is a local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor and is clinically used for that purpose, particularly in the eye, ear, nose, and throat. It also has powerful central nervous system effects similar to the amphetamines and is a drug of abuse. Cocaine, like amphetamines, acts by multiple mechanisms on brain catecholaminergic neurons; the mechanism of its reinforcing effects is thought to involve inhibition of dopamine uptake.",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00907
Benzodiazepine,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB12537/thumb.svg,"Benzodiazepine is under investigation for the prevention of Delirium and C.Surgical Procedure; Cardiac. Benzodiazepine has been investigated for the treatment of Obesity, Sleep Apnea, Obstructive, and Disorders of Gallbladder, Biliary Tract and Pancrease.",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB12537
Ethanol,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB00898/thumb.svg,"A clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body. It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages.",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00898
Oxycodone,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB00497/thumb.svg,"Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic derived from thebaine in Germany in 1917 It is currently indicated as an immediate release product for moderate to severe pain and as an extended release product for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.Label The first oxycodone containing product, Percodan, was approved by the FDA on April 12, 1950",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00497
Methadone,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB00333/thumb.svg,"Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. As a full MOR agonist, methadone mimics the natural effects of the body's opioids, endorphins, and enkephalins through the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission.",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00333
Amphet,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB00182/thumb.svg,"Amphetamine, a compound discovered over 100 years ago, is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers.1 The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976. During World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00182
Tramad,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB00193/thumb.svg,"Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to codeine and morphine. Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization's pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of morphine.",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00193
Hydrocodone,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB00956/thumb.svg,"Hydrocodone is a synthetic opioid derivative of codeine. It is commonly used in combination with acetaminophen to control moderate to severe pain. Historically, hydrocodone has been used as a cough suppressant although this has largely been replaced by dextromethorphan in current cough and cold formulations. Hydrocodone's more potent metabolite, hydromorphone has also found wide use as an analgesic and is frequently used in cases of severe pain. The FDA first approved Hydrocodone for use as part of the cough suppressant syrup Hycodan in March of 1943",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00956
Oxymorphone,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB01192/thumb.svg,"An opioid analgesic with actions and uses similar to those of morphine, apart from an absence of cough suppressant activity. It is used in the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including pain in obstetrics. It may also be used as an adjunct to anesthesia (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1092). On June 8, 2017, FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals to remove the medication from the market due to opioid misuse and abuse risks associated with the product's injectable reformulation.",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01192
Morphine,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB00295/thumb.svg,"Morphine is the main alkaloid of opium and it was first obtained from the poppy seeds in 1805 It is the most potent analgesic for chronic pain but its use is limited due to the induction of tolerance, severe withdrawal symptoms and high risk of relapse and abuse. In its pure form, morphine is ten times more potent than opium and due to this property, it was used extensively in the US Civil War which resulted in approximately 400,000 addicted soldiers. After this event, around the second half of the nineteenth-century, the science made several efforts to find a less addictive alternative which brought the synthesis of heroin. However, morphine is still the precursor to other opioids such as codeine, fentanyl, methadone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, and oxycodone. Morphine's first official product was developed by West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Int. and FDA approved in 1984.",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00295
Hydromorphone,https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/DB00327/thumb.svg,"Hydromorphone is a pure opioid, a semi-synthetic hydrogenated ketone derivative of morphine that has been available clinically since 1920. Structurally, hydromorphone derived from morphine in the modification of the hydroxyl group in the carbon 6 to a carbonyl and the absence of a double bond between the carbon 7 and 8. Due to these modifications, it presents a very high potency and comparable side effect profile to the parent compound. Even though hydromorphone does not present a 6-hydroxyl group, it is categorized under the family of phenanthrenes and it is considered a chemical under the schedule II (medical purposes with high addiction potential).

The first reported approved product containing hydromorphone in the form of hydromorphone hydrochloride was developed by Fresenius Kabi USA and FDA approved in 1984.",https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00327
